            <h2>Project Development</h2>
            <p> After getting feedback and doing some brainstorming I have a bit better of an idea of what kind of thing I want to create but I still need to figure out specifics of my project.
                - I am concerned that some ideas I have may be a bit too simple in terms of interaction because I am intimidated by the coding I might have to do
                - I wonder if I need to take some time to research some css techniques I don't know yet to be able to achieve things I need to do
                - I will go over the class materials like slides and files to make sure I have everything I need for the class.
