            <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
            <p> <img src = "images/skyimg.jpeg" alt = "photo of sky"> <figcaption>Shampave Kandiah, 2025</figcaption> This image taken by Shampave Kandiah is an image depicting a sunset on her commute from campus. This is a very well taken shot that catches the sky at a beautiful but fleeting moment, and was meant to capture what the ride back home looked like for Shampave at the time. It is obvious that she wanted to keep that moment of the visually beautiful sky, but it is also a bit mysterious in the sense that the image has no figures or subjects, just the landscape and the reflection of the window, meaning the emotions are a bit subdued and open to interpretation. To push visual thinking and narrative, this image could be moving across the screen to simulate for the user what taking this picture could've felt like, or somehow collaged together with other images.  </p>

            <p> <img src = "images/concertimg.png" alt = "photo of concert"><figcaption>Kat Cho, 2025</figcaption> This image was taken at the concert for my favorite band when they played at the Fox Theatre in Oakland. I have loved this band since high school and being able to see them live was very special to me, especially since I saw them with friends from highschool who also love that band. It relates to my topic because it is an example of a live music event that was really special to me and shows why I really love live music. I want to add interactive visual effects to the image to try and make them more compelling. </p>

            <h2>Visual Thinking and Strategies Research</h2>
            <p><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a> is a New York Times article by Michael Goncha that explains the steps to close reading and the skill of noticing details in a visual format. The article includes specific numbered instructions such as asking upen ended questions or be detectives that are accompanied by pictures that prompt the reader to investigate closely. In the case of website building, heavily featuring images can be a powerful tool for design purposes and can get a strong message across in a unique way, but websites that are very minimal in text can have drawbacks as the accessibility of the site can be impacted for those with screen readers. However, using images in an interactive way can be fun and a way to inspire close reading of images and visual thinking skills.   </p>

            <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a> Is an article by Kathryn Whitenton that explains the best ways to determine situations to use overlays as a design solution since overlays and lightboxes can be used poorly to the detriment of users. Lightboxes and Overlays are used to deliver important information to users without losing context of the original content. Whitenton describes a "five W's" solution- Who, What, When Where and Why. The advice is to make overlay content accessible, consider the target audience, the action of the user, the timing of the overlay's appearance, the location of the overlay, and the reason for the overlay specifically.  </p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> Is an article by Salim Ansari about ways to boost form usability when constructing form style interactions with a user. Ansari gives 20 tips on ways to maximise user understanding. Tips include things like minimizing input fields in order to prioritize relevant information, distinguishing optional and required fields to lessen user confusion, utilizing placeholder text in specific areas to provide guidance to the user, and more. These tips really clarified to me things that I hadn't specifically noticed in the past but that either elevated or hindered my ability and experience filling out forms online.These things can be key in retaining or losing users and maintaining a level of quality and professionalism that is important to keep in mind as a designer. </p>
