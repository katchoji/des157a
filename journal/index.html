            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> Is an article by Salim Ansari about ways to boost form usability when constructing form style interactions with a user. Ansari gives 20 tips on ways to maximise user understanding. Tips include things like minimizing input fields in order to prioritize relevant information, distinguishing optional and required fields to lessen user confusion, utilizing placeholder text in specific areas to provide guidance to the user, and more. These tips really clarified to me things that I hadn't specifically noticed in the past but that either elevated or hindered my ability and experience filling out forms online.These things can be key in retaining or losing users and maintaining a level of quality and professionalism that is important to keep in mind as a designer. </p>

            <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a> Is an article by Kathryn Whitenton that explains the best ways to determine situations to use overlays as a design solution since overlays and lightboxes can be used poorly to the detriment of users. Lightboxes and Overlays are used to deliver important information to users without losing context of the original content. Whitenton describes a "five W's" solution- Who, What, When Where and Why. The advice is to make overlay content accessible, consider the target audience, the action of the user, the timing of the overlay's appearance, the location of the overlay, and the reason for the overlay specifically.  </p>

            <h2>Visual Thinking and Strategies Research</h2>
            <p><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a> is a New York Times article by Michael Goncha that explains the steps to close reading and the skill of noticing details in a visual format. The article includes specific numbered instructions such as asking upen ended questions or be detectives that are accompanied by pictures that prompt the reader to investigate closely. In the case of website building, heavily featuring images can be a powerful tool for design purposes and can get a strong message across in a unique way, but websites that are very minimal in text can have drawbacks as the accessibility of the site can be impacted for those with screen readers. However, using images in an interactive way can be fun and a way to inspire close reading of images and visual thinking skills.   </p>
